# Pitch Effectiveness Rating (PER) System

## Overview

The Push Performance Insights Engine now uses a **Pitch Effectiveness Rating (PER)** system that provides a 0-100 scale for evaluating pitch effectiveness in specific ball-strike counts. This system maintains the scientifically accurate weights that affect xRV while providing clear, actionable insights for pitch selection.

## Scoring Scale

| PER Range | Category | Recommendation | Description |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| 95-100 | Elite | Strongly Recommended | Exceptional performance for this count |
| 85-94 | Excellent | Recommended | Very effective pitch for this situation |
| 75-84 | Good | Consider | Above-average effectiveness |
| 65-74 | Above Average | Use sparingly | Moderately effective |
| 55-64 | Average | Avoid | Neutral effectiveness |
| 45-54 | Below Average | Avoid | Below-average performance |
| 35-44 | Poor | Avoid | Poor effectiveness |
| 0-34 | Very Poor | Avoid | Very poor performance |

## How PER is Calculated

1. **Individual Metric Scoring**: Each metric (whiff rate, chase rate, weak contact rate, etc.) is scored based on its percentile performance relative to league benchmarks
2. **Weighted Combination**: The individual scores are combined using scientifically validated weights that reflect each metric's impact on xRV
3. **Count-Specific Adjustments**: Scores are adjusted based on the difficulty of each ball-strike count
4. **Final PER**: The result is a 0-100 score indicating overall pitch effectiveness

## Scientific Foundation

The weights used in PER calculation are based on research into how different outcomes affect expected run value (xRV):

- **Hard Hit Rate**: High weight (0.5-0.9 depending on count) - Hard contact significantly increases xRV
- **Whiff Rate**: Medium-high weight (0.2-0.5 depending on count) - Swinging strikes are highly valuable
- **Called Strike Rate**: Medium weight (0.1-0.3 depending on count) - Called strikes advance the count favorably
- **Weak Contact Rate**: Medium weight (0.1-0.3 depending on count) - Weak contact reduces xRV
- **Chase Rate**: Low weight (0.01-0.1 depending on count) - Chasing can be beneficial in certain situations

## Count-Specific Considerations

Different ball-strike counts have different strategic priorities:

- **0-0, 1-0, 2-0**: Focus on avoiding hard contact and getting strikes
- **0-1, 1-1, 2-1**: Balance between avoiding hard contact and generating swings
- **0-2, 1-2, 2-2**: Prioritize whiffs and called strikes
- **3-0, 3-1, 3-2**: Focus on getting strikes and avoiding walks

## Using PER for Pitch Selection

1. **Primary Recommendation**: Choose the pitch with the highest PER for each count
2. **Secondary Options**: Consider pitches with PER ≥ 75 as viable alternatives
3. **Avoid Poor Options**: Generally avoid pitches with PER < 55
4. **Context Matters**: Consider game situation, batter tendencies, and pitch sequencing

## Example Interpretation

If a 4-Seam Fastball has a PER of 85 in a 0-2 count:
- This indicates "Excellent" performance
- The pitch is "Recommended" for this count
- It performs in the top 20% of all pitches in this situation

## Benefits of the New System

1. **Clear Actionability**: 0-100 scale is intuitive and provides clear guidance
2. **Maintains Scientific Accuracy**: Uses the same validated weights as before
3. **Count-Specific**: Accounts for the different strategic priorities of each count
4. **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded system makes quick assessment easy
5. **Comprehensive**: Considers all relevant metrics that affect pitch effectiveness
6. **Realistic Scoring**: Generous thresholds ensure elite pitchers receive appropriate high scores

## Migration from Old System

The previous 0-10 scale has been replaced with the 0-100 PER system:
- Old 7.5+ (Good) → New 85+ (Excellent/Elite)
- Old 3.5-7.5 (Average) → New 55-84 (Average to Good)
- Old <3.5 (Poor) → New <55 (Below Average to Very Poor)

This provides much more granular and actionable information for pitch selection decisions while ensuring realistic scores for all performance levels.
